# Home Assistant Integration

Guide for integrating hisense2mqtt with Home Assistant.

## Prerequisites

1. **MQTT Integration** enabled in Home Assistant
2. **MQTT Broker** (Mosquitto add-on or standalone)
3. **hisense2mqtt** running and connected

## Automatic Discovery

When `options.discovery: true` (default), entities are automatically created in Home Assistant:

| Button | `button.hisense_10_0_0_194_up` | Navigate up |
| Button | `button.hisense_10_0_0_194_down` | Navigate down |
| Button | `button.hisense_10_0_0_194_left` | Navigate left |
| Button | `button.hisense_10_0_0_194_right` | Navigate right |

## Media Player Card

Add a media player card to your dashboard:

```yaml
type: media-control
entity: media_player.hisense_10_0_0_194
```

## Custom Remote Card

Create a TV remote using buttons:

```yaml

## Manual MQTT Configuration

If auto-discovery is disabled, configure entities manually:

### Media Player

```yaml
# configuration.yaml
mqtt:
  media_player:
    - name: "Hisense TV"
      unique_id: "hisense_tv_living_room"
      state_topic: "hisense2mqtt/10_0_0_194/state/power"
      command_topic: "hisense2mqtt/10_0_0_194/set/power"
      volume_level_topic: "hisense2mqtt/10_0_0_194/state/volume"
      volume_level_template: "{{ value | float / 100 }}"
      set_volume_topic: "hisense2mqtt/10_0_0_194/set/volume"
      mute_state_topic: "hisense2mqtt/10_0_0_194/state/mute"
      mute_command_topic: "hisense2mqtt/10_0_0_194/set/mute"
      availability_topic: "hisense2mqtt/10_0_0_194/state/available"
      payload_available: "online"
      payload_not_available: "offline"
      payload_on: "ON"
      payload_off: "OFF"
```

## Troubleshooting

### Entity Not Appearing

1. Check MQTT integration is connected
2. Verify discovery_prefix matches HA settings
3. Check hisense2mqtt logs for errors
4. Restart Home Assistant

### Entity Shows Unavailable

1. Check hisense2mqtt is running
2. Verify TV is powered on
3. Check network connectivity
4. View logs: `docker compose logs hisense2mqtt`

### Commands Not Working

1. Verify UUID is from paired device
2. Check TV accepts MQTT connections
3. Try toggling power from the TV physically first
4. Enable debug logging: `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`
